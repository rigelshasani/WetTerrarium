# WetTerrarium Stability & Performance Improvements

This document summarizes the reliability, stability, and performance improvements made to the WetTerrarium project.

## Reliability Fixes

### Memory Safety
- **Bounds Checking**: Added bounds validation to `Chunk::get/set` methods preventing out-of-bounds access
- **Null Pointer Protection**: Added null pointer validation in World constructor with descriptive exceptions
- **Division by Zero**: Fixed potential division by zero in floor division functions

### Resource Management
- **Cross-platform Font Loading**: Implemented robust font loading with fallbacks for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Texture Creation Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for TileAtlas texture creation
- **Memory Limits**: Implemented configurable chunk limits (default: 1000) with distance-based pruning

## Stability Improvements

### Input Validation
- **Coordinate Validation**: Added overflow protection and NaN/infinity checks for coordinate conversions
- **Camera Input Safety**: Validated window sizes, delta times, and movement bounds
- **World Parameters**: Added validation for view parameters and tile IDs

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operation when fonts fail to load
- **Invalid Input Handling**: Safely ignore invalid resize events and malformed coordinates
- **Resource Failure Recovery**: Proper exception throwing with descriptive messages

## Performance Optimizations

### Rendering Performance
- **Frustum Culling**: Only render chunks visible in the current view (plus 1-chunk buffer)
- **Lazy Batch Rebuilding**: Mark tile batches as dirty instead of immediate rebuilds
- **On-demand Updates**: Rebuild batches only during draw calls when needed

### Memory Management
- **Distance-based Pruning**: Remove chunks by distance when exceeding memory limits
- **Two-phase Cleanup**: First remove out-of-view chunks, then enforce hard limits
- **Efficient Chunk Storage**: Uses 32-bit signed integers for coordinate system

## Architectural Improvements

### Modularity
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation between dirty tracking and rebuilding
- **Error Isolation**: Individual components handle their own validation
- **Configurable Parameters**: Memory limits and bounds are easily adjustable

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: Proper use of 32-bit integer types for coordinates
- **Const Correctness**: Maintained const correctness throughout the codebase
- **RAII Patterns**: Proper resource management following C++ best practices

## Impact Summary

- **Crash Prevention**: Eliminated all identified potential crash points
- **Performance Gains**: Reduced CPU overhead from batch rebuilding and GPU load from culling
- **Memory Stability**: Prevented unbounded memory growth during world exploration
- **Cross-platform Reliability**: Robust operation across different operating systems
- **Maintainability**: Improved error reporting and debugging capabilities

These improvements transform WetTerrarium from a functional prototype into a stable, production-ready game engine foundation.
